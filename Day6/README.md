Jenkins is an open-source automation server written in Java. It is widely used for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) — core practices in DevOps that help developers deliver software faster and more reliably.

Key Features of Jenkins
Automation of Builds and Tests:

Jenkins automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code, which helps in early detection of bugs.

Plugin-Based Architecture:

Jenkins has 1000+ plugins to support building, deploying, and automating any project.

Easy Integration:

Integrates with tools like Git, Maven, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Slack, etc.

Pipeline Support:

Jenkins supports declarative pipelines (written in code using Groovy) to define the CI/CD workflow.

Distributed Builds:

You can distribute jobs across multiple machines to improve performance.

Let’s say you're working on a web app. You can use Jenkins to:

Pull your latest code from GitHub.

Run unit tests automatically.

Build the application.

Deploy it to a staging server.

Notify your team via Slack or email.
