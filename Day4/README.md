DAY 4
What is Docker  ?
Docker is a tool that packages your application and everything it needs (like code, libraries, dependencies) into a container. Think of a container like a mini-computer that runs your app the same way on any machine.
Benefits of Docker:
Works the same on any computer or server (no “it works on my machine” issues).

Easy to share and deploy.

Lightweight and fast compared to traditional virtual machines (VMs).

What is kubernetes(k8s) ?
Kubernetes (aka K8s) is a system for managing a bunch of Docker containers. It helps run your app on many machines, restart it if it crashes, scale it up if needed, etc.
Benefits of Kubernetes:
Automatically scales your app (more users = more containers).

Handles load balancing (sends users to the best container).

Self-heals (if one container fails, it replaces it).

Lets you deploy updates without downtime.
